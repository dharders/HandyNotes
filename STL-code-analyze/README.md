# 2022.6.17

I started to learn the code in `c++stl` recently, and I chose this book as my reference. However, because it is written in 2002 when there is no `c++11`, `c++14` or etc., I decided to read the code in `gcc12.1` in the order of the book content. 

Thus, these are my note in reading `gcc12.1`. I marked the page number in the book where the code referred, also the file and the line of the code like `file[line]` in gcc library for comparing and learning.

These files are classified accroding to chapters in book.
