## `display: contents`

If you set an element to `display: contents`, the element itself will no longer generate any box (box model), it will look as if it has disappeared from the DOM. However, its child elements will continue to exist, and they will receive the layout impact from the parent of the original `display: contents` element.

## `justify-self`

`justify-self` property is used for aligning an item within a grid or flex container. This property determines the alignment of the element along the inline axis (horizontal line) within its grid cell (for Grid layout) or shrink-to-fit box (for Flex layout).
